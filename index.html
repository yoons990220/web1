  <p>
  Webs, formerly Freewebs, is a freemium, primarily static site-only web host founded in 2001.
  The service offers free and premium website hosting plans, and their own templated website building service.
  Unusually, Webs does not offer any dynamic content support aside from their own dynamic "apps", despite offering FTP access and allowing HTML uploads.
